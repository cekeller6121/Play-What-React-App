This is my first major React project for The Iron Yard. We just started looking at React this Wednesday, so to be honest it's pretty heavy and I'm not too comfortable with it yet. I plan on diving in and getting some data to display to the screen! The function of the app is to pull in data from an API that would mimic being able to share a current song and suggest it to others.
